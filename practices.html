		<h2>Common Practices</h2>
		<p><i>"The rules you were given were the rules that worked for the person who created them." Ellen Langer</i></p>
		<h3>Writing Papers</h3>
		<h4>Planning</h4>
		<p>When is your paper due? Are you currently frantically writing for a deadline? The next time you start to write a paper, consider using a <a href="https://deviparikh.medium.com/planning-paper-writing-553f497e8839">paper writing plan</a> with multiple phases of iteration to relieve some of the pressure.</p>
		<h4>Structure of an Introduction</h4>
		<p>There is no one <i>true</i> way to write the Introduction of a paper. This structure outlined here is based on <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/writing/content.html">Sharon Goldwater's notes on Writing Research Papers</a>.
		<ul>
			<li>Situate: What is the overall context of the work? Is there an overarching theoretical or practical context?</li>
			<li>Open problem: What is the specific open problem studied in this paper? Why is it important?</li>
			<li>Approach: Briefly, how do we approach the open problem? Is there any motivation for this approach?</li>
			<li>Findings: If we conducted any experiments, what are the main findings? Why are these findings important?
		</ul>
		<h4>Problem Formulations</h4>
		<p>A well-written Problem Formulation makes it easier for the reader to understand the task we are working on, and any assumptions about the data and evaluation. I learned about the importance of this section from <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap">Mirella Lapata</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07252.pdf">Example 1</a>) and used it in Section 2 of the IJCNLP paper (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/I17-1014/">Example 2</a>) but there are other examples, such as Section 2.1 (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P05-1012.pdf">Example 3</a>) or Section 3 — Section 3.1 (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1044.pdf">Example 4</a>).</p>
		<h4>Recapping Assumed Knowledge</h4>
		<p>Sometimes it is useful to briefly recap what the reader is expected to know in order to understand your paper. Section 2 of <a href="https://aclanthology.org/Q17-1026.pdf">this TACL paper</a> does an excellent job of recapping what the reader needs to know.</p>
		<h4>Describing Your Model</h4>
		<p>If you explain can explain your model clearly then readers could even re-implement it themselves. <a href="https://aclanthology.org/Q17-1026.pdf">Section 4 of this paper</a> has a succinct model description with an excellent illustration. <a href="https://aclanthology.org/N16-1180.pdf">Section 3 of this NAACL paper</a> has a clear model description and supporting figure. In our own work, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15124.pdf">Section 3 of this TACL paper</a> uses precise notation to explain the model, which is then re-used to explain the connection between different types of models. <a href="https://aclanthology.org/I17-1014.pdf">Section 3 of this IJCNLP paper</a> explains exactly how the model is designed. <a href="https://aclanthology.org/K19-1009/">Section 5 of this CoNLL paper</a> tries to present a comprehensive treatment of the model, with an illustrative figure.
		<h4>Wording</h4>
		<p>Sometimes it can be difficult to find the words to express yourself. <a href="https://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/">The Academic Phrasebank</a> is a useful resource and inspiration for how to write academic-sounding sentences, but be careful to avoid writing in cliched academese.</p>
  		<p>It is tempting to use complicated words to make your work sound impressive. Use <a href="https://sarneckalab.blogspot.com/2018/12/chapter-10-words.html">good words</a> instead!</p>
		<h4>Tables</h4>
		<p>Good tables are difficult but <span style="font-family:monospace;">booktabs</span> helps. Here is <a href="https://people.inf.ethz.ch/markusp/teaching/guides/guide-tables.pdf">some guidance</a> on how to design tables using this package.</p>
		<h3>Reviewing Papers</h3>
		<p>Reviewing papers is an important part of our job and we should remember that it’s a voluntary service that we do for others and they do for us too. I think it is optimal to review papers on topics where you believe you have some expertise because you can quickly identify the main contributions of the work.
		How should you go about review papers? That’s tricky but there is some useful guidance out there. The ACL provides a <a href="https://aclrollingreview.org/reviewertutorial">reviewing tutorial</a> to help you understand the role and goal of peer review. There was also a <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/citizenofcvpr/">CVPR workshop</a> on being a good citizen of the community.
		<h3>Author Response</h3>
		<p>Many conferences and journals allow authors to respond to their reviews to correct technical misunderstandings or to provide additional results and analyses. First step: take a deep breath. There are often misunderstandings between what you wrote and what the reader understood. Second step: take a look at Devi Parikh's <a href="https://deviparikh.medium.com/how-we-write-rebuttals-dc84742fece1">How we write rebuttals</a>. Third: we use a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZUEmHBwvR6T4uwBN79l2x5_vjgunL5dVATe3nMSw6_U/edit?usp=sharing">review response template</a> to prepare our rebuttal in collaboration with all the authors.</p>
		<h3>Talks</h3>
		<p>Giving talks is a crucial part of our work because we are communicating our research and findings to other people. We aim for the following with our talks:
		<ul>
		    <li>Have a clear message;</li>
		    <li>Present a self-contained story about the contribution of our work; and</li>
		    <li>Engage the audience.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We usually practice our talks in-advance and incorporate feedback from the rehearsal audience.</p>
		<p>You should ask other people for advice on how to structure your talk. It usually takes several iterations to <i>get it right</i>.</p>
